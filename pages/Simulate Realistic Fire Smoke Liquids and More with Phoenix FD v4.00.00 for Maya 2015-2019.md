In this article, we will explore some of the new and improved features of Phoenix FD v4.00.00 for Maya 2015-2019. These features will help you create more realistic and complex fluid dynamics simulations in Maya.
 
## New Voxel and Particle Tuners
 
One of the most powerful features of Phoenix FD v4.00.00 for Maya 2015-2019 is the new Voxel and Particle Tuners. These nodes allow you to change any grid or particle channel during simulation, depending on conditions based on grid or particle channel values, textures or distance to meshes. For example, you can use the Voxel Tuner to change the temperature, density, viscosity or color of your fluid based on a texture map or a mesh proximity. You can also use the Particle Tuner to change the size, speed, lifespan or color of your particles based on a gradient or a noise map. You can also use these nodes to delete voxels or particles that meet certain criteria, such as being too far from the source or too slow.

## New Active Bodies
 
Another exciting feature of Phoenix FD v4.00.00 for Maya 2015-2019 is the new Active Bodies node. This node allows you to add basic rigid body simulation to your liquid simulations, so that you can float your objects over pools or wash them away in floods. You can use any mesh as an active body and set its mass, friction and buoyancy properties. You can also choose how the active body interacts with the liquid simulator, whether it affects the velocity, pressure or both. The active body solver is fast and stable and can handle multiple objects in one simulation.
 
## New Tex UVW Channel
 
Another useful feature of Phoenix FD v4.00.00 for Maya 2015-2019 is the new Tex UVW channel. This channel allows you to transport texture coordinates along your fluid during simulation and use them for advanced render-time effects. For example, you can use the Tex UVW channel to map a texture to your fluid surface or volume color and opacity, and have it move with the fluid motion. You can also use the Tex UVW channel to add displaced detail to your fluid surface that moves with the fluid in all render modes.
