What makes Reason Drum Kits 2.0 ReFill different from other drum libraries is that it uses Reason 3.0's Combinator device to capture every aspect of the drum sound: the drums themselves, the room surrounding them, the drummer, the microphones, the outboard gear, and even the producer's signature sound. You can load up a kit and mix it to your liking, or choose from one of the Producer Kits that emulate famous producers' drum sounds by recreating their signal flow and effects chains.
 
Reason Drum Kits 2.0 ReFill was recorded at Stockholm's world famous Atlantis Studio using Propellerhead Software's Hypersampling method[^1^] [^2^]. This means that each drum was recorded with multiple velocity levels, multiple microphones, multiple same velocity samples, and multiple variation samples. This results in a natural and dynamic drum performance that responds to your playing style and expression.
 
The refill comes with 17 preset kits covering pop/indie, funk/soul and rock/metal genres[^2^] [^3^]. You can also use the style templates to get the sound you are looking for, or create your own custom kits using the individual drum samples. You can also use Reason Drum Kits 2.0 ReFill as a standalone drum studio and drummer by using ReWire-enabled audio recording software such as ProTools, Logic or Live[^2^].
 
Reason Drum Kits 2.0 ReFill is available at Propellerhead Software's dealers worldwide or directly from their website for $129 USD[^2^]. If you already own Reason Drum Kits 1.0, you can upgrade for $36 USD[^2^]. If you want to hear how Reason Drum Kits 2.0 ReFill sounds and see how it works, you can watch a video at www.propellerheads.se[^2^].
 
Reason Drum Kits 2.0 ReFill is more than a fantastic collection of natural sounding drum kits. It is a live drum recording session in a refill.
  
## Benefits of Reason Drum Kits 2.0 ReFill
 
One of the main benefits of Reason Drum Kits 2.0 ReFill is that it gives you the flexibility and control to shape your drum sound according to your musical needs. You can adjust the levels of the close, overhead and ambience microphones, as well as apply EQ, compression and effects to each drum individually or to the whole kit. You can also swap drums within a kit or create your own custom kits from scratch using the individual drum samples[^1^] [^4^].
 
Another benefit of Reason Drum Kits 2.0 ReFill is that it delivers a realistic and expressive drum performance that responds to your playing style and expression. The Hypersampling method ensures that each drum has a full dynamic range, a natural variation and a human feel. You can also use the included MIDI files to trigger the drums with different grooves and styles, or record your own MIDI patterns using a keyboard or a pad controller[^1^] [^2^].
